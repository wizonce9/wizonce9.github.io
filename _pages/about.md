## Self-Introduction

I am currently a Software Engineering student at **Peking University**, with a passion for the intersection of **AI, audio processing**, and **music therapy**. Growing up, I have always been fascinated by music, having learned both **guitar** and **piano** from a young age. I have developed a strong foundation in music theory and performance, which naturally led me to explore **computer music**.

My journey into the world of **audio processing** and **music generation** began when I realized how AI could enhance our understanding and creation of music. I’m deeply interested in developing AI-driven models that can assist in therapeutic music generation and audio analysis, creating systems that combine **music theory** with cutting-edge technologies.

I am now applying for graduate studies in the **audio processing** and **music generation** fields, where I aim to further develop technologies that bridge the gap between music, therapy, and AI.

## Research Experience

### **Graduation Project: Personalized Intelligent Music Therapy Using Wearable Devices**  
*2024.July - 2024.Jan*  
In my graduation project, I led the development of a **personalized music therapy system** that integrates wearable device data with **AI-generated music** to provide therapeutic benefits. This system used **SUNO generative music models** and **HRV data**, along with **LightGBM-based emotion detection**, to create personalized music that improved the mood and psychological well-being of users. After conducting three randomized controlled experiments with 90 participants, the system showed significant improvements (**p** < 0.01) in mental health outcomes.

### **A Novel Physical Modeling Approach for Sound Synthesis of Chinese Chime Bells**  
*2024.Oct - 2024.Jan*  
As a third author in this project, I contributed to the development of a **physical modeling approach** for synthesizing **Chinese chime bell sounds**. By analyzing acoustic data from the **Marquis Yi of Zeng chime-bell set**, we created two synthesis models using **digital waveguide techniques** that replicated the bells' distinctive dual-tone characteristics. This paper is currently under review at **PLOS ONE**.

### **National Undergraduate Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program: A Method for Analyzing Stock Price Volatility Based on Market Sentiment**  
*2021.Mar - 2022.Apr*  
I led the development of a method to predict **stock price volatility** by analyzing sentiment in stock forum discussions. Using a **BERT-based sentiment analysis model** combined with **XGBoost**, we were able to predict market movements and provide early warnings of abnormal fluctuations. The model also incorporated **Shewhart control chart theory** to support predictions for companies and investors.
